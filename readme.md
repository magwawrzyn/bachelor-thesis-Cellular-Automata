## Abstract

Aim of Bachelor thesis ”Cellular Automata in partial differential equations” is to show that partial differential equations are a big source of cellular au- tomata. Thesis begins with gathering and sorting basic information about cellular automata. First half of this work focuses on precisely defining cel- lular automata, classification and reminds us of the most popular cellular automata. Next thing spoken of in the thesis are cellular automata deri- ved from differential equations, like diffusion equation or reaction-diffusion. Important part of this thesis are code examples written in R programming language, which were used to put exemplary cellular automata to a test and to create numerous simulations, which we can observe in my work. Thesis ends with bibliography.
